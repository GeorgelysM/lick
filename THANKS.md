I would like to thank the following people for their help or inspiration:

- ICPUG (Brian Grainger) from murga-linux.com, who wrote Lin'n'Win, which the 9X and NT
  install methods are based on.
- The grub4dos and grub2 development teams.
- The Linux Foundation for their Secure Boot System.
- Reines and Robert F. Gage for creating "Real DOS-Mode Patch for Windows ME"
  and "Me2Dos", respectively. Without this, Windows ME support wouldn't be possible.
